            <li>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca),
                also known as the panda bear or simply panda,
                is a bear species endemic to China.
                It is characterised by its black-and-white coat and
                rotund body. The name "giant panda" is used to
                distinguish it from the distantly related red panda.
                Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb),
                and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in)
