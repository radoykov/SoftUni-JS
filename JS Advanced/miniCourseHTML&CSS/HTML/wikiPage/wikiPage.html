    <h1><strong>The Brown Bear</strong></h1>

    <p>
        The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America.
        It is one of the largest land carnivorans, rivaled in size only by its closest relative,
        the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average.
        The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males average around 30% larger in most populations.
        Brown bears are often not fully brown; the pelage can be reddish to yellowish-brown, and dark brown to cream in
        color.
        They are the only extant bears with a hump formed entirely of muscle on their shoulders.
        The paws are large and allow the bear to effectively dig through dirt.
        Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.
